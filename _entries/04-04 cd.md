### Create a release pipeline

You just pushed the container image to the registry. You will now deploy your application as a running container inside Openshift. A deployment can be done in different ways:
- using command line with **oc** commands
- using OpenShift Portal
- using a deployment pipeline

Of course, we'll choose the last one.

If you remember, the Todo application will require a CosmosDB database and we need to provision one in Azure. Instead of using the Web portal and create the database manually, we are going to use the mechanism of *Infrastructure as Code* and use an ARM template file (we could use a terraform file too). Infrastucture as code, means that you describe your architecture in a file and you let the cloud provider creating the infrastructure based on the file. The advantages are numerous:
- configuration is in a file, not in your head or a Visio schema
- not need to document it, the file is a source of trust
- configuration is source-based, we have an history of it
- file is applied at each deployment ensuring that infrastructure is always identical to the file (it does NOT recreate resources if they are already present)

You can find an precooked-file in the repository: **deploy/cosmos-todo.json**
This template will provision a database with all the required parameters and will ask the pipeline to create it for us, only when required. Furthermore, the template is idempotent, which means that it won't recreate a database if it already exists.

```json
"resources": [
        {
            "apiVersion": "2019-12-12",
            "kind": "GlobalDocumentDB",
            "type": "Microsoft.DocumentDb/databaseAccounts",
            "name": "[parameters('name')]",
            "location": "[parameters('location')]",
            "properties": {
                "databaseAccountOfferType": "Standard",
                "enableMultipleWriteLocations": false,
                "isVirtualNetworkFilterEnabled": false,
                "virtualNetworkRules": [],
                "ipRangeFilter": "",
                "dependsOn": [],
                "capabilities": [],
                "enableFreeTier": false
            },
            "tags": {
                "defaultExperience": "Core (SQL)",
                "hidden-cosmos-mmspecial": "",
                "CosmosAccountType": "Non-Production"
            }
        }
    ]
```

#### Create the release pipeline

Create a release pipeline named **CosmosTodo-Release**

{% collapsible %}

On the left menu, click on **Release** and then on the button **New release pipeline**. A side pane opens, just click on the top button **Empty job**

![New pipeline](media/lab1/azdo-cd.png)

{% endcollapsible %}

Let's start by adding our source code as artifact (=input) because we will have to use the ARM template but also a manifest to deploy the application itself

{% collapsible %}

On the left part of the screen, click on **Add an artifact**, and select your repository

![Add an artifact](media/lab1/azdo-cd2.png)

{% endcollapsible %}

It's now time to add some actions (tasks) to our pipeline:

- one to provision the database
- one to deploy our application in OpenShift

Click on the block **"**Stage 1** and click on the button-link **1 job, 0 task**

![Configure step](media/lab1/azdo-cd3.png)

#### Provisioning the database

Then click on the button to add tasks

![Add task](media/lab1/azdo-cd4.png)

Add a task of type **ARM template deployment** and configure it to use the ARM template

{% collapsible %}

![Add task](media/lab1/azdo-cd5.png)

Don't forget to override parameters, which means the template will per default have default values but you have the possibility to update the values, without changing the template directly

```
-name "cosmosdb-unique-name" -location "westeurope"
```

{% endcollapsible %}

Once the task has been added, save and run your pipeline (=create a release). Go back to Azure portal to check if your database has been created properly and retrieve the credentials to access it

{% collapsible %}

To get credentials, open the cosmosdb screen and on the left menu, click on **Keys**. You need to save the URI and the primary key because you are going to use them later

![Get database information](media/lab1/azdo-cd20.png)

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Deploying the application

If you look in the source code repository, you will find an existing YAML file to deploy your container **manifest/cosmos-todo.yaml**

As you can see, some parts need to replaced with your values. You are going to inject them dynamically through the pipeline

``` yaml
.
.
.
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: cosmos-todo
        image: #{CONTAINER-IMAGE}#:#{CONTAINER-VERSION}#
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        env:
        - name: COSMOSDB__DB_URL
          value: "#{DB_URL}#"
        - name: COSMOSDB__DB_SECRET
          value: "#{DB_SECRET}#"
.
.
.
```

First, let's inject some variable in our pipeline:

- CONTAINER-IMAGE: which is static and link to the container you published previoulsy
- CONTAINER-VERSION: which is the tag number of your image
- DB_URL: which is the URL of your CosmosDB database
- DB_SECRET: which is one of the key to access your database

The DB_URL and DB_SECRET have been retrieved just before and the other two values can be found in the container registry (either the Azure one or the OpenShift one depending on what you used)

{% collapsible %}

![Published container](media/lab1/azdo-ci8.png)

{% endcollapsible %}

Add these variables inside the pipeline, making sure that the *CONTAINER-VERSION* variable is settable **at release time** and that the *DB_SECRET* variable is "locked" (hidden).

{% collapsible %}

> Note that in a real-life pipeline, we would **dynamically** retrieve the DB_URL and DB_SECRET from the ARM tasks and reinject them directly (can be done with a script or [preexisting task](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=keesschollaart.arm-outputs)). It allows to discover these variables at release time, very useful when you want to run the pipeline only once and the database does not exist yet. We won't do it here to simplify the lab.

Open the **Variables** tab, add the four variables, and fill them with relevant values. Let CONTAINER-VERSION empty but check the **Settable at release time** property. Don't forget to click on the lock in front of the DB_SECRET value. It means that once you leave the screen, the secret is protected and nobody can display its value anymore

![Replace task](media/lab1/azdo-cd6.png)

{% endcollapsible %}

Let's add a **[Replace Token](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=qetza.replacetokens&targetId=9518b9a5-0dd5-4cc4-9a5a-47ad866bcc13)** task to inject these variables

{% collapsible %}

This task will look for existing variables and replace the corresponding tokens in the file (=they just need to have matching names). You just need to point to your YAML file

![Replace task](media/lab1/azdo-cd7.png)

{% endcollapsible %}

The last part of the pipeline will be the deployment on OpenShift. For that you'll need to add **two** OpenShift tasks:

- The first one will ensure that we are targeting the right project (in case you have access to several projects and in order not to fall into *default* project either) with the command `oc project`.
- The second case will simply deploy the yaml file `oc create -f cosmos-todo.yaml`

> If you didn't create an OpenShift Service Endpoint (=connection string) in the first part to push into the internal registry, you will have to create a new one to allow Azure DevOps to access your OpenShift cluster. 

{% collapsible %}

You want your pipeline to connecto OpenShift and deploy your application, but instead of using your own credentials or your session token (which is only valid for 24 hours), you are going to create a dedicated service account

#### Create a dedicated service account for a namespace

For security reasons, we will define a service account able to perform actions against the namespace (= name of the project your created earlier).

```
oc create sa app-pusher -n <MY_NAMESPACE>
```

#### Add rights 

Now the service account (sa) image-pusher is only able to connect to its namespace. Let's add it rights to deal with the internal registry.

First, we add the role to deploy application (it could be a good practice to create a custom role with just enough rights)

```
oc policy add-role-to-user admin system:serviceaccount:<MY_NAMESPACE>:app-pusher -n <MY_NAMESPACE>
```

### Retrieve the secret name 

The service account has severals secrets 

```
oc describe sa app-pusher -n <MY_NAMESPACE>
```

![Getting secret info](media/lab1/azdo-cd19.png)

Let's inspect the secret content to get the token ! (replace with the name of the relevant token)

```
oc describe secret app-pusher-token-6frjm -n
```

Now, on the bottom left corner of Azure DevOps portal, click on **Project Settings** and then on **Service EndPoints**. Then create a "OpenShift" endpoint and specify URL and Token.
The URL can be retrieve from OpenShift portal - [from login command](media/lab1/login-command.png).

![Adding OpenShift Endpoint](media/lab1/azdo-cd18.png)

{% endcollapsible %}

> To select the oc tasks you may need to install the OpenShift extension the first time. Click on **Get it free** and follow the steps to add it to your DevOps organization.

{% collapsible %}

Add two tasks (named *Execute oc command*):

![Adding OpenShift task](media/lab1/azdo-cd8.png)

On the first task, select your Service connection and fill the command field with `oc project <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>`

![Selecting project](media/lab1/azdo-cd12.png)

On the second task, do the same but with a command pointing to your Yaml file (injected as artifact) `oc create -f $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/_Cosmos-Todo/manifest/cosmos-todo.yaml`

> Warning: in the path, "_Cosmos-Todo" is here the name of your artifact, the name you gave when you added it to your pipeline. By defaut: _<NAME_OF_PROJECT>

![Deploying app](media/lab1/azdo-cd13.png)

> Don't forget to check **Ignore non success return value** because on the second run, the Yaml file will say that a namespace already exists and the pipeline will consider it as a fatal error, while it's not.


Click on **Save**, your pipeline is now ready.

{% endcollapsible %}


It's time to trigger a release

{% collapsible %}

Click on **Create release**. You just have to fill in the tag version of your published image. Remember, it's the number you got after pushing the container image

> If is does not offer to fill the CONTAINER-VERSION variables, it means that you forgot in variables tab, to click on the checkbox **set at runtime**

![Deploying app](media/lab1/azdo-cd14.png)

{% endcollapsible %}

If the pipeline is successful (marked green), you should be able to connect to the OpenShift portal and see your application being deployed and running.

> If you decided to use Azure Container Registry, you may see that your application is not working. The next block will help you to troubleshoot it

{% collapsible %}
If you open the console and go in the details of your deployment, you'll see that pods are failing with ImagePullBackOff error. It means that they are not allowed to download your image from the registry.

![Deploying app](media/lab1/azdo-cd15.png)

It's logical, your registry is secured by default, there is no reason anybody could use it without proving themself and thus the OpenShift cluster is not authorized to pull images. Let's fix that

Open the Azure portal and look for your Container Registry. Inside the **Access Keys** panel, activate the **Admin user**. Note the server URL, the login and one of the password.

![Deploying app](media/lab1/azdo-cd16.png)

We are going to store these credentials inside the cluster. Now, open the OpenShift console and on the left navigation bar, click on **Workloads > Secrets**. Click on create a new secret with a type of **Image pull secrets**. Fill the information you just retrieved before

![Deploying app](media/lab1/azdo-cd17.png)

Last part, inside the OpenShift portal (or by modifying the Yaml file in your source code and redeploying), just add the imagePullSecret property to the deployment. You can open the deployment and edit the Yaml file directly

```yaml
spec:
  imagePullSecrets:
        - name: NAME_OF-YOUR-SECRET
  containers:
  - name: cosmos-todo
    image: #{CONTAINER-IMAGE}#:#{CONTAINER-VERSION}#
    ports:
    - containerPort: 8080
    env:
    - name: COSMOSDB__DB_URL
      value: "#{DB_URL}#"
    - name: COSMOSDB__DB_SECRET
      value: "#{DB_SECRET}#"
```

Save and let few seconds. Your pods should now be working properly
