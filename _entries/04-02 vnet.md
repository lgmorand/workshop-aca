Azure Container Apps is based on Kubernetes and whenever you create an ACA environment, it deploys within a VNet, a single AKS instance (Azure Kubernetes Service), [configured with CNI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/configure-azure-cni) and a single **public** standard Load Balancer which allow your applications hosted in ACA to be exposed and accessible from Internet.
