### Build the application

You will now build and create a container image of your image application and the common practice is to publish it in a dedicated library of containers called a registry (docker.com is a famous one). In our case we will use private registries only accessible by us.
You have the choice **between** using:

- [Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/)
- [OpenShift Internal Registry](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/registry/registry-options.html)

### Using Azure Registry

In your terminal, run the **az acr create** command to provision a new registry on your subscription

{% collapsible %}

> **Warning** ACR name must be unique and cannot contains spaces, dash, etc.

```sh
az acr create --resource-group <RESOURCE-GROUP> --name <ACR_NAME> --sku Basic
```

{% endcollapsible %}

Then in Azure DevOps, go an create a visual (WYSIWYG) build pipeline and named it *"Cosmos-todo CI"*. Use it to build and publish the container image to the registry ? 

> Note: Azure DevOps also allow to create [pipeline as code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema), which means the pipeline itself is described by a YAML file in your repository. We'll stick to "visual" pipeline for didactic reason but the good practice would be to use YAML pipeline.

{% collapsible %}

Go in the pipeline section and click on **New pipeline** and select at the bottom **use the classic editor**

![New pipeline](media/lab1/azdo-ci.png)

Select your repository

![Repository selection](media/lab1/azdo-ci2.png)

Select the **Docker Container** template.

![Template selection](media/lab1/azdo-ci3.png)

You obtain a ready-to-use pipeline, configured to build on a Linux agent, and ready to build and push the container. You just need to specify which registry to use.

Click on the first task **Build an image** and on the right part, click on **Manage** to create a *service endpoint*. A service endpoint is like a connection string, it allows Azure DevOps to authenticate against an external service.

![Service Endpoint creation](media/lab1/azdo-ci4.png)

Once there, click on **New service connection** and select **Azure Resource Manager**

![Service Endpoint creation](media/lab1/azdo-ci5.png)

Then, select the **automatic** Service Principal (except is you were provided with one)

Finally, select your subscription and give a connection name. No need to specify the resource group here.

![Service Endpoint creation](media/lab1/azdo-ci6.png)

Come back to your pipeline and select the **Build an image** task and now, selection the Azure subscription and then the registry previously created. If the newly created service endpoint is not present in the dropdown list, just click on the refresh button.

![Task configuration](media/lab1/azdo-ci7.png)

Perform the same action on the second task (**Push an image**). It's done, your pipeline is ready.

**Save and queue** it (let all parameters with default values), it should start after few seconds and when the result is successful after 2-3min, you should be able to go in your registry within OpenShift, and see your container being published

{% endcollapsible %}

### Using Openshift Internal Registry

Alternatly you can also push the container image inside the Red Hat OpenShift Container **internal** registry. The registry is a core part of the OpenShift Container platform leveraging Azure Disk storage technology. 

{% collapsible %}

### Create SA account to push / pull OCP internal registry

To access the internal Red Hat OpenShift registry, we will define a service account which is a Kubernetes object able to connect OpenShift and access API resources to control the platform. Find more informations :
<https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/authentication/understanding-and-creating-service-accounts.html>

#### Create a dedicated service account for a namespace

For security reasons, we will define a service account able to perform actions against the namespace we have created earlier.

```
oc create sa image-pusher -n my-namespace
```

#### Add registry viewer and editor rights 

Now the service account (sa) image-pusher is only able to connect to its namespace. Let's add it rights to deal with the internal registry.

First, we add the role to view the registry

```
oc policy add-role-to-user registry-viewer system:serviceaccount:my-namespace:image-pusher 
```

Then we set the role to edit images in the registry

```
oc policy add-role-to-user registry-editor system:serviceaccount:my-namespace:image-pusher
```

### Get Service account credentials

Now, we will retrieve the token located in the secrets related to the service account.

#### Retrieve the secret name 

The service account has severals secrets 

```
oc describe sa image-pusher
```

![GitHub Logo](media/lab1/token_name.png)

Let's inspect the secret content to get the token !

```
oc describe secret image-pusher-token-n2lgz
```

The token is : eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InAt ...


![GitHub Logo](media/lab1/token_registry.png)

Keep it for the Docker registry credentials in the following steps


### Expose OpenShift internal registry

The Red Hat OpenShift registry is deployed by default without an external route. Thanks to the OpenShift load-balancer, exposing a service is very simple, Let's create it !

#### Create the default route to access internal registry

```
oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster --patch '{"spec":{"defaultRoute":true}}' --type=merge
```

#### Retrieve external registry route

```
oc get route default-route -n openshift-image-registry --template='{{ .spec.host }}'
```

>default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.wyzs8mtl.eastus.aroapp.io

This route is an example. Yours will be different.
We will use this route to define the registry Docker connection service in Azure DevOp.

### Add OpenShift registry credentials to Azure DevOps 

We will use 4 key informations to push the image built on with the previous Azure DevOps pipeline created :
* The service account as the docker login
* The service account token as the password (it doesn't expire)
* The external route registry 
* The namespace in which the image will be pushed

#### Add a Docker push task in the pipeline

Go back to the first pipeline we have created and we will add a new task.

![GitHub Logo](media/lab1/add_docker_task.png)

1. Add a task
2. Search for push
3. Choose Docker

#### Add a custom Docker registry connection

Click on the "Manage" button

![GitHub Logo](media/lab1/create_docker_registry_connection.png)

#### Set Docker Registry credentials 

Remember the 4 key informations we have gathered in the previous part, it's time to use them.

![Docker registry connection](media/lab1/docker_registry_connection.png)

1. **https://** default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.xxx.xxx.com 

2. image-pusher

3. The token retrieved earlier with the oc describe secrets ...

4. A simple name for the registry connection


#### Set push task informations

![Docker registry connection](media/lab1/set_docker_task.png)

1. Change action to "Push"
2. **your-openShift-workspace**/$(Build.Repository.Name):$(Build.BuildId)
3. Tick "Include latest tag"

The OpenShift workspace here is very important because the service account used to push image has the specific rights only for your namespace

Check the image has been successfuly pushed into the OpenShift registry with the following command :

```
oc get is -n my-namespace
```

> Note the name of your container image and its tag, you will use it in the next chapter

![Docker registry connection](media/lab1/image_stream.png)

We can see the image built is now in the registry because an image stream has been created. It represents the metadata of the image with its tags. It allows to manipulate without its registry location (on-premise, private, public ..).

This image stream will be used in the next step to deploy the image in OpenShift.
