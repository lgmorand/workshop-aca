Welcome to the **Azure Container Apps workshop**. In this micro OpenHack, you'll go through tasks that will help you master the basics and more advanced topics required to deploy applications to Azure Container Apps. This exercice can be done alone or in group and will take between 1 and 3 hours.

> This workshop is **NOT** an official resource from the product group. They are currently working on dedicated and up to date content. This workshop may not be up to date with the very last features of Azure Container Apps but we work hard to do so. Don't hesitate to read the official documentation to [read more about Azure Container Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/).
