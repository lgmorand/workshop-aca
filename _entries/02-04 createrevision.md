A revision is an immutable snapshot of a container app. The first revision is automatically created when you deploy your container app. New revisions will be automatically created when a container app's template configuration changes. Indeed, while revisions are immutable, they are affected by changes to global configuration values, which apply to all revisions.

Revisions are most useful when you enable ingress to make your container app accessible via HTTP. Revisions are often used when you want to direct traffic from one snapshot of your container app to the next. Typical traffic direction strategies include A/B testing and BlueGreen deployment.

The following diagram shows a container app with two revisions.

> Note that changes made to a container app fall under one of two categories:
>
> - `Revision-scope` changes are any change that triggers a new revision (e.g: changes to containers, add or update scaling rules, changes to Dapr settings, etc.)
> - `Application-scope` changes don't create revisions (e.g: changes to traffic splitting rules, turning ingress on or off, changes to secret values, etc.)

### Create your first revision

By default your container app is set on "single revision mode". It means that each new revision will ecrase the current revision and take all the incoming traffic. To have several revisions running at the same time you must enable the "multi-revision mode" on your containerapp.

Go to the revision management blade on the left inside of the container apps panel. At the top of the page you'll find the "choose revision mode" option where you'll be able to choose the revision mode.

Let's create and deploy a new version of the Hello World application with a different layout. To do so, you will have to deploy a new container within our application, meaning that we're doing a revision-scope change. This new version of our application can be found on docker hub `mavilleg/acarevision-helloworld:acarevision-hellowold`. (yes, there is a typo)

Once this new revision is provisionned, we will configure an even split of the traffic between the two revisions applied by assigning percentage values. You can decide how to balance traffic among different revisions. Traffic splitting rules are assigned by setting weights to different revisions.

Go to the revisions management blade on the left inside of the container apps panel.
Click on `Create a new revision`

You now have two options:
- Edit the existing container image definition
- Add a new one but you **must** delete the existing one or your deployment will fail because the two containers are targeting the same port.

Let's use the Add option, so click on `Add` in order to pull the new image that will be used to create the new revision.

Once your new revision is provisioned, you can split the traffic between them using the revision management panel within the Azure portal. Hitting the endpoint will result serving one of the revision depending on the chosen ponderation (in %).

> Note that new revisions may remain active until you deactivate them, or you have to your container app to automatically deactivate old revisions (called `single revision mode`).

- Inactive revisions remain as a snapshot record of your container app in a certain state.
- You are not charged for inactive revisions.
- Up to 100 revisions remain available before being purged.

You can see all revisions using the `az containerapp revision list`and have more detail on a specific one using the `az containerapp revision show` command.

{% collapsible %}

```bash
az containerapp revision list \
  --name my-container-app \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
  -o table
```

``` bash
az containerapp revision show \
  --revision <REVISION_NAME> \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP
```

{% endcollapsible %}

Remember with the `revision mode` and set it up on "multi". This way, you can have multiple revisions at the same time, which is commonly used for A/B testing or blue-green scenarios. Or you can use single revision mode to automatically replace the current version by the new one.

Now, have fun and perform canary deployment. Put weight on both revisions with 50% of traffic for each.

Once done, reopen the URL of your containerapp and refresh the page a dozen of times. You should randomly get the previous version or the new one.
